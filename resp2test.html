                <p>28 yo female with cc of sinus pressure and pain. Unable to work recently since she can't concentrate and is very tired. She is a receptionist, and her voice is hoarse to the point of being hard to understand. Feels pain in her cheeks every step she takes steps up the stairs to the third floor of her apartment. Pain started 10 days ago, getting worse. She has tried IBU and acetaminophen. Sleeping is hard due to bad cough. This has happened 3-4 times/year for last year. She's been treated with ABX 4 times this year. Three episodes of this in spring. She has felt warm but has not taken her temp. Her R ear is occasionally painful, "stuffy". She has been using the “neti pot" but hasn't helped. Has no allergies and isn't taking any meds. PE: BP 110/68, pulse 85, temp 38, RR 20 and unlabored. Hoarse hypo nasal voice with diminished volume, dark circles surround her eyes, mouth breathing during interview. R tympanic membrane is retracted and lacks a good cone of light. Erythematous, boggy inferior turbinates and thick clear nasal discharge, posterior oropharynx shows post-nasal drainage and cobblestoning. Indirect laryngoscopy with mirror shows edema of true and false vocal cords. High arched palate with crowding of maxillary teeth. No cervical lymphadenopathy is appreciated. Lungs show diffuse wheezing.</p>

Reduce bronchial hyperreactivity, decrease inflammation. Do NOT directly bronchodilate.</p>

Hx of "severe allergies" as a youngster with “cradle cap" at 6 months as a newborn, eczema and impetigo as a toddler, and atopic asthma until age 16. She had to take 2 types of inhalers, but was never an oral steroids, never hospitalized, or intubated. She did go to the ED at least once each fall from age 5-15 years. She could not afford “allergy shots” that her physician recommended. Her current symptoms are related to cough, sneeze, runny nose, and "pinkeye" that start about the first of April, improve in June, and remit after first frost (Seasonal - Spring/Fall implies pollen/mold). She expresses interest in taking some treatment for herself, so the child will not have the health challenges she faces. Her only med is oral contraceptive. PE: mildly erythematous and boggy nasal turbinates, no lymphadenopathy, 1+ enlarged tonsils, 1+ conjunctivitis.</p>

Best practical step is likely starting Azithromycin now, culture optional). The rationale provided seems flawed regarding treatment delay. However, based *strictly* on the options and rationale given in text, this might be the intended answer, prioritizing confirmation/delay over immediate alternative treatment despite positive rapid test. A better option would be "Start Oral Azithromycin". Given the provided options and rationale, the safest *action* among these choices, considering the severe allergy, might be interpreted as confirming before treating with anything potentially cross-reactive, even though Azithro is usually safe. This is confusing.) **Let's select Oral Azithromycin as the clinically most appropriate next step despite the text's rationale potentially pointing elsewhere.**</li>

            <p>55 yo to ED with wheezing, extreme SOB x 2 hours refractory to OTC inhaler. Was feeling well until a week ago, when he got a “cold" that manifested as fever of 101.5, muscle aches, dry cough that changed to a cough productive of yellow-green sputum over next 5 days, and anorexia. Last seen by doctor 2 years ago for acute SOB that responded to nebulizer, IV abx, and an infusion that "made my heart do flip-flops in my chest". No current meds, can't afford time off. BP 128/88, pulse 120, temp 100.4 F (38 C), RR 28 with accessory muscle use. PE: rhonchi and wheezes diffusely throughout the chest, protuberant abdomen with paradoxical movement when he breathes, and 1+ clubbing of fingers. Arterial blood gas: pH 7.32, pCO2 48 mm Hg, pO2 68 mm Hg. Low potassium, high bicarb, high glucose. Elevated WBC. UA 1+ glucose, 1+ ketones. ECG: tachycardia no acute signs of acute MI. A PA and lateral chest x-ray shows a patchy right lower lobe infiltrate, with some evidence of chronic hyperinflation, and a prominent right atrial shadow. (Dr. Elliot forgot to include that this patient smokes).</p>
